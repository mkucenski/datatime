datatime
========
A recreation of of The SleuthKit's 'mactime' with a goal of faster results and allowing integration of timeline data from other sources (EVT, LNK, Firewall, etc.). 

NOTE: While this code compiles, it was written several years ago based on an older version of The SleuthKit's "body" format. It needs to be udated based on the TSK3.x format.

Description
-----------

The goal of this project was/is to use TSK's body format to integrate timeline data from other sources such as firewall logs, log records, shortcut files, network data (PCAP), etc. to focus and visualize combined events to understand what was happening at a specific time.

As you can see from the [formatting notes](#formatting-notes), I'm really just "shoehorning" other text data records to line up as best as possible with the TSK conventions. Obviously, not all of the TSK filesystem concepts make sense for other types of data.

While I'm not convinced the TSK "body" format is really the best or most flexible format to use for this application, it provided an easy and acceptable solution at the time I wrote it.

Another goal of this project was to increase the speed of sorting/processing the records and providing usable results to the analyst. It has been many years since I conducted any tests, but as I recall this application was able to process records *much* faster--a requirement when you start adding massive amounts of firewall, network, and other data on top of already vast filesystem records.
