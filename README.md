datatime
========
A recreation of of The SleuthKit's 'mactime' with a goal of faster results and allowing integration of timeline data from other sources (EVT, LNK, Firewall, etc.). 

NOTE: While this code compiles, it was written several years ago based on an older version of The SleuthKit's "body" format. It needs to be udated based on the TSK3.x format.

Detailed Description
--------------------

The goal of this project was/is to use TSK's body format to integrate timeline data from other sources such as firewall logs, log records, shortcut files, network data (PCAP), etc. to focus and visualize combined events to understand what was happening at a specific time.

As you can see from the [formatting notes](#formatting-notes), I'm really just "shoehorning" other text data records to line up as best as possible with the TSK conventions. Obviously, not all of the TSK filesystem concepts make sense for other types of data.

While I'm not convinced the TSK "body" format is really the best or most flexible format to use for this application, it provided an easy and acceptable solution at the time I wrote it.

Another goal of this project was to increase the speed of sorting/processing the records and providing usable results to the analyst. It has been many years since I conducted any tests, but as I recall this application was able to process records *much* faster--a requirement when you start adding massive amounts of firewall, network, and other data on top of already vast filesystem records.

Dependencies
------------
* [popt](http://www.freecode.com/projects/popt/)
* [Boost Date-Time](http://www.boost.org)
* [autoconf-archive](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/autoconf-archive/)
* [My libdelimText](https://github.com/mkucenski/libdelimText)
* [My libtimeUtils](https://github.com/mkucenski/libtimeUtils)

Bugs
-----
* The libdelimText library needs to better handle delimiters and qualifiers. Qualifiers were disabled for this project due to problems with how it worked. Unfortunately, firewall log records coming out of my fw2mactime application can include a '|' in the URL--this causes obvious errors in parsing the line for mactime compatible fields. 

Wishlist
-----
* Ability to filter by uid/gid (or SID)--let you find and visualize all files owned by a particular user/group.
	** How can you make tsk_gettimes or fls export the uid/gid in the body file? tsk_gettimes doesn't seem to do it by default.
* More complex selection of filters? Multiple date ranges, uid/gid, etc.?
* Ability to filter by folder (i.e. if uid/SID unavailable; filter by user folder and their recycle bin).
* Filtering based on known good files (i.e. NSRL)
	** How to get hash values into this process? Preprocessing forensic image to link file to hash?
